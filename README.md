## MMRC Convention *(english)*
_Heavily based on the [Homie Convention](https://homieiot.github.io) by David Gr√§ff and contributors_

The MMRC convention strives to be a **communication definition on top of MQTT** to be used by IoT devices on a model railroad **for control and reporting**.
Its purpose is to help developers quickly get their IoT devices to communicate with other devices in a standardized way.

MQTT is an easy way to communicate between IoT devices, for example Arduino, Raspberry Pi and simular.
However, MQTT doesn't define the structure and content of these messages and their relation.

This convention therefor defines a **standardized way** of how IoT devices and services announce themselves and their data on the communication channel. It also **defines the structure of MQTT topics and the allowed range/types for payloads**.
